# Chapter 16: Case Studies of Metallic Shy Grind Applications - The Case of the Mysterious Jet Engine Failure

Ladies and gentlemen, gather around as we present to you yet another intriguing mystery solved by the great detective, Sherlock Holmes. This time, we take you on an adventure related to Metallic Shy Grind and its application in the aviation industry.

The famous aviation company, AeroCorp, had recently experienced a significant setback when one of their jet engines failed during a flight. The cause of the failure was unknown, and it threatened the safety of all passengers. The company immediately hired Sherlock Holmes to solve this mystery.

As soon as Holmes arrived at the AeroCorp facility, he met with our special guest, Dr. John Doe, who had been a consultant for the company for several years. Dr. Doe had been researching the effectiveness of Metallic Shy Grind in enhancing the durability of jet engine components.

Holmes began his investigation by examining the jet engine that failed, and after a thorough analysis, he discovered that its failure was due to the wear and tear of a specific part's metallic components. The part, an encoder disc that detected the engine speed, had worn out over time and was the cause of the malfunction.

Upon discovering the root cause of the failure, Holmes brought in Dr. Doe to validate the findings. Together, Holmes and Dr. Doe suggested that the Metallic Shy Grind technique could be implemented to prevent such an occurrence in the future.

The team then perused Dr. Doe's research papers and case studies related to Metallic Shy Grind in the aviation and aerospace industries. They found that this technique significantly prolonged the life expectancy of various components in jet engines and had proven to be highly effective in reducing maintenance and repair costs.

AeroCorp, impressed by these findings, immediately implemented the Metallic Shy Grind technique in the manufacturing process of their jet engines, and saw a significant reduction in the number of failures and maintenance costs.

The mystery of AeroCorp's jet engine failure might have initially puzzled everyone, but thanks to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Doe, it was solved using the innovative Metallic Shy Grind technique.
In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we explored the use of Metallic Shy Grind in the aerospace industry by solving the mystery of AeroCorp's jet engine failure. Here, we discuss the code used to resolve the mystery.

Metals experience stresses and apply stresses to components under working environments. It can be challenging to identify the root cause of metal component failure. To mitigate this problem, strain gauges are installed on components, which measure the strain of the metal.  

In this mystery, Holmes conducted a strain analysis of the components using the following code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv('strain_data.csv')
stresses = np.array(data['stress'])
strains = np.array(data['strain'])
plt.plot(strains, stresses)
plt.xlabel('Strain')
plt.ylabel('Stress')
plt.show()
```

This read the strain data from a CSV file, `strain_data.csv`, and created two NumPy arrays - `stresses` and `strains`, which represent the stress and strain data, respectively. The `matplotlib` library is then used to plot these values in a graph.

After conducting the strain analysis, Holmes identified the specific part that caused the jet engine failure. This particular component, the encoder disc, typically wears out due to the constant rotating forces it is subjected to. Metallic Shy Grind was suggested as a solution to extend the component's life expectancy.

To validate this solution, Dr. Doe presented his research on Metallic Shy Grind. As part of his research, he used the following code snippet to simulate the effects of the metallic grind on the component's life expectancy:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).reshape((-1, 1))
y = np.array([10, 23, 30, 43, 50, 63])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict([[7]])

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color='red')
plt.show()
```

This code simulates the effects of time, using the independent variable, `X`, and the dependent variable, `y`, which represents the component's life expectancy. It uses the `LinearRegression` function from the `sklearn` library to create a linear regression model and predict the life expectancy after seven iterations. The result is then plotted on a graph using `matplotlib`.

The code used in the mystery, therefore, showcased the practical application of data analysis and machine learning in solving real-world problems within the aerospace industry.
