# Chapter 12: Optimization Techniques for Metallic Shy Grind

As we have learned previously in Chapter 11, the grinding parameters play a critical role in achieving a high-quality Metallic Shy Grind. However, there is still room for improvement to achieve the perfect grind. That is where optimization techniques come into the picture.

In this chapter, we are privileged to have a special guest, Dr. Jane Taylor, who is a well-known expert in the field of optimization techniques. Dr. Taylor has conducted significant research in the field of optimization techniques and has published many articles and journals on this topic.

Optimization techniques aim to determine the best possible set of parameters to produce the desired metallic shy grind with minimum effort and resources. Finally, the aim is to optimize both the outcome and the cost of the operation. It is, therefore, essential to understand these techniques for those who desire to produce metallic shy grinds of the highest quality.

In upcoming sections of this chapter, we'll explore different optimization techniques such as Response Surface Methodology, Taguchi Method, Artificial Neural Network, and others. We'll learn how to model the relationship between the parameters and the quality characteristics of the metallic shy grind and optimize these relationships to achieve the optimal grinding parameters. 

Let's get started with the first optimization technique, Response Surface Methodology (RSM), with Dr. Jane Taylor leading the way!
# Chapter 12: Optimization Techniques for Metallic Shy Grind

Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion, Dr. John Watson, were summoned to a metallic shy grind processing plant where peculiar problems had continued to plague the grinding process. The plant owner, Mr. Charles Basker, was desperate because he had invested heavily in the plant, and its grinding process was critical to the success of his business.

Upon their arrival, Holmes and Watson met with the senior engineer of the plant, Mr. George Stoppard, who explained their situation. 

"We have tried adjusting the grinding parameters, but they always seem to lead to unfavorable outcomes," Mr. Stoppard told Holmes and Watson. "We need to optimize our grinding process to get the best quality metallic shy grind with minimum resources and effort."

Holmes immediately knew where the solution lay - optimization techniques!

Dr. Jane Taylor, an expert in optimization techniques, was called upon to assist in the investigation. After conducting a thorough analysis, Dr. Taylor realized that optimizing the grinding process would require implementing optimization techniques that would enable them to determine the best possible parameters to obtain the desired metallic shy grind quality.

Dr. Taylor started by explaining how the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) could be used to find the optimal parameters of the grinding process. RSM could create a mathematical model of the relationship between parameters and the quality of the metallic shy grind.

Dr. Taylor explained that the RSM uses the central composite design for data collection and subsequently fits the model, explaining the relationship between the parameters and the quality outcome. It is then possible to optimize the model to obtain the best grinding parameters necessary to achieve the highest quality metallic shy grind.

Holmes and Watson were impressed with Dr. Taylor's knowledge and expertise, and they decided to implement the RSM at the plant. They gathered data on the grinding process and fed them into the model. The created model was then used to find the optimal grinding parameters which minimized resource utilization while maximizing the quality of the metallic shy grind.

Thanks to Dr. Jane Taylor and her knowledge of optimization techniques, the grinding process was successfully optimized, and the plant was able to produce high-quality metallic shy grinds with much less hassle!
# Explanation of the Code Used to Resolve the Sherlock Holmes Mystery

To optimize the grinding process, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was implemented. RSM uses a sequence of mathematical models to characterize the relationship between the grinding parameters and the quality of the metallic shy grind.

The central composite design (CCD) was used to generate the necessary data points. CCD is a method of data analysis used to create a mathematical model of the relationship between the parameters and quality outcome. The generated data can then be analyzed to fit the model of the grinding process based on the selected variables.

To implement the CCD, the `statmod.rsm` package in R was utilized. The package provides tools for building and optimizing RSM models. First, we created the design matrix using the `ccd.matrix()` function, specifying the factor levels, and the number of center points.

```r
# creating design matrix using the CCD
library(statmod)
design <- ccd.matrix(nvars=3, type="rotatable", center=TRUE)
```

Next, the optimal factor levels were determined using `rsm()` function. The response variable (quality outcome) was defined as the concentration of metallic shy grind in parts-per-million (ppm).

```r
# creating the RSM model
rsm_fit <- rsm(conc ~ A + B + C + A:B + A:C + B:C + I(A^2) + I(B^2) + I(C^2), 
               data = dataframe, center = TRUE, block = block, ntrials = nrow(design))
```

In the above code, `conc` is the response variable, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three parameters of the grinding process. The `A:B`, `A:C`, and `B:C` terms are the interaction of these three parameters to establish any synergistic or antagonistic effects. The `I(A^2)`, `I(B^2)`, and `I(C^2)` terms represent any non-linear relationships amongst these parameters.

Finally, the optimization was performed using `optim()` function in R. It uses the `predict()` function to predict the concentration of the metallic shy grind at various combinations of the grinding parameters, based on the generated model. With this approach, the optimal factor levels were determined, which significantly reduced resource utilization while maximizing the quality of the metallic shy grind.

```r
# optimizing the RSM model
optim(rsm_fit, optimize = "conc", center = TRUE)
```

In conclusion, by utilizing RSM and coding techniques in R programming language, Holmes and his team was able to optimize the grinding process and successfully solve the mystery. The statistical tools such as CCD design, RSM model building, and optimization techniques helped to reduce grinding process efforts and cost while producing the highest quality of metallic shy grind.
